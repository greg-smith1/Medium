Russia,"Winning the right to host the World Cup must have been the only way this team, arguably the poorest in the history of Russian football, would get a chance to play at this tournament. The 2017 Confederations Cup at home, therefore, acted as the only real test for Russia, who stopped at a group stage after beating New Zealand but losing to Portugal and Mexico. In total, Russia have played 19 matches since Euro 2016 and won just six (against Ghana, Romania, Hungary, New Zealand, Dinamo Moscow and Korea Republic). They haven't won since October 2017, and conceded 10 goals in four friendlies against Argentina, Spain, Brazil and France. Is there one? That's really a tough call to make. Igor Akinfeev can still do wonders between the sticks, although he's prone to unthinkable blunders now and then. A triangle of Alan Dzagoev, Aleksandr Golovin and Fedor Smolov could produce something non-trivial in attack. Besides, Cherchesov has been trying to make his team work hard, pressing with quick transitions between defense and attack. It rarely works, but when it does it could be called this team's biggest strength. Defence has been considered the weak link of the Russian national team for many years. When the CSKA trio of Sergey Ignashevich and the Berezutski brothers (who are still considered the best despite being 38 and 35 years old, respectively) decided to quit international football, things only got worse. After his appointment, Cherchesov started playing five at the back, but since the start of 2018 he's lost two of the regular three centre-backs (Viktor Vasin and Georgi Dzhikiya) to long-term injuries. The coach had to start looking for new partnerships all over again, but six conceded goals and a huge amount of goal-scoring opportunities for opponents in this year's two friendlies show that it hasn't been an easy task. Fedor Smolov is probably the biggest Russian star at the moment. The 28-year-old striker took a while to transform from a talent to becoming the country's main striker. Giving up on the posh life and breaking up with a former model (Viktoriya Lopyreva, who's now one of the official World Cup ambassadors) coincided with his rise. He became the top Russian Premier League scorer in two successive seasons (20 goals in 2015-16, 18 goals in 2016-17) with FC Krasnodar, and he's currently on par with Spartak's Quincy Promes (14 goals scored each) in the hunt for a third straight golden boot in Russia.
The skillful striker, who's equally good at finishing and passing, has a dream to play for one of Europe's big clubs and may use the World Cup to convince them to take a gamble on him. Something needs to be done about the way Russia defend, but nearly all of the defenders Cherchesov has tested after Vasin and Dzhikiya's injuries have failed to prove their level. What we saw in the March friendlies showed that there's no light at the end of the tunnel."
Saudi_Arabia,"Saudi Arabia secured their place at the World Cup finals for the first time since 2006 with a second-place finish in their AFC qualifying group behind Japan. A 1-0 win over the already qualified Japanese in their final group match, courtesy of Fahad Al Muwallad's second-half goal, saw Saudi Arabia finish ahead of Australia on goal difference. While Saudi Arabia are on their third coach in less than a year, the squad is built on a solid core of players. Drawn mainly from Saudi Premier League champions Al Hilal and runners-up Al Ahli, the key players know each other well, and that cohesion is unlikely to be disrupted despite the decision to send a group that included Yahya Al Shehri, Salem Al Dawsari and Fahad Al Muwallad, on loan to clubs in Spain in January. The move hasn't worked -- Al Muwallad and Al Dawsari are the only ones who got minutes, a lone substitute appearance each -- but the spirit in the squad should see the players overcome some of these issues. A lack of experience at the highest level is one of several problems facing Saudi Arabia as they embark on their first trip to the World Cup finals in 12 years. None of the most likely contenders for Juan Antonio Pizzi's side have played in a World Cup, and the country has a poor record in continental tournament play in recent years, failing to advance far at the Asian Cup in 2011 and 2015. Other issues include Pizzi's lack of preparation time with the squad; the Argentina-born coach was appointed only in November, leaving both tactician and players a little more than six months to work together ahead of Russia. Yahya Al Shehri has established himself as the star playmaker for a Saudi Arabia side that has a relatively settled feel and that played at a level beyond the sum of its parts to qualify for Russia. Al Shehri is often given a licence to roam from his position behind striker Mohammed Al Sahlawi, and it is from deep that he can cause the most problems as he slips into positions where he can turn and face the opposition. The 27-year-old has spent much of his professional career with Riyadh-based Al Nassr, although he was sent on loan to Leganes in Spain in January, where his lack of playing time in La Liga could have a huge impact on his fitness going into the World Cup. In general, I'm not optimistic about Saudi [Arabia]. I believe they were fortunate not to get a stronger group. But the lack of a clear vision since qualifying will hurt them in Russia. The Spain experience has been an utter failure, and Pizzi has been merely playing a catch-up game to get them back into the level they were already at under [former coach Bert] Van Marwijk It has been a long time since Saudi Arabia made fans sit up and take notice at a World Cup, and it is unlikely Pizzi's team will earn many plaudits when they take to the field in Russia. While the group they have been handed is far from difficult, Saudi Arabia's lack of quality and experience in top-class tournament play makes it unlikely they will progress beyond the group. They will at least have the honour of becoming the first Asian nation ever to play in the opening game when they take on Russia in Moscow on June 14, and their meeting with the hosts arguably represents their best hope to take something from the competition."
Egypt,"Egypt capitalised as Ghana lost their way, first under Avram Grant and then under Kwesi Appiah, to establish a five-point lead over the Black Stars after their first two matches. They weren't made to pay for a shock defeat away in Kampala against Uganda in August, as Ghana failed to beat Congo-Brazzaville at home, and then took a major step toward the finals when Mohamed Salah settled the return clash in Alexandria. The Liverpool superstar was again the hero in their penultimate group game against Congo, when he stepped up to convert a 94th-minute penalty after Arnold Bouka Moutou had cancelled out his 63rd-minute opener. It was a nerveless finish by the ""Egyptian Messi"" that took Egypt to their first World Cup since 1990 and prompted scenes of jubilation across the North African nation. One of the biggest questions going into the World Cup will be: Will Mohamed Salah be there? The 26-year-old suffered a shoulder injury playing for Liverpool in the Champions League final and it is estimated he will miss three weeks. If that is the case, he will be a doubt to face Uruguay on June 15. If he does make it, there aren't too many players in world football in better form than Salah, whose stock has been transformed since returning to the Premier League with Liverpool this season. Egypt's group stage opponents are likely to struggle to silence Salah, while his momentum could help the Pharaohs topple a heavyweight or two as the tournament progresses. Beyond Salah, Egypt are limited and you can expect accusations of the Pharaohs being a one-man team to persist throughout the summer. If the Liverpool man is not there otr, even if he is, gets neutralised by opponents, they can lack a Plan B while, too often, Cuper's conservative approach means that the team can struggle to shift gears. If things don't go their way early in matches, or if they fall behind, the Pharaohs are in danger of running out of ideas. Mohamed Elneny's injury concerns also threaten to deny them a forceful personality and a valuable midfield presence. Fitness permitting, all eyes will be on Salah this summer, and unsurprisingly so. There haven't been many African players in history who could match his output and contribution in the Premier League this term, and a strong tournament may see him end Africa's wait for a second Ballon d'Or winner. Of course, Egypt don't attack teams in the same way as Liverpool, but the responsibility of playing for his nation can bring the best out of Salah, too -- as he demonstrated by topping Africa's scoring charts during qualification. However, will a long season as part of Jurgen Klopp's intense, draining Liverpool side leave Salah with enough in the tank to maintain his form? The mood is high, and players and fans alike are excited. Obviously, there have been some negative issues, like the Salah saga with the EFA, which we hope will be solved soon, coupled with Elneny's injury and Ahmed El-Shenawy's ACL injury which ruled him out of the World Cup. Regardless of those things, I am sure we have the players to take us through to the round of 16 as a minimum. Again, this is predicated upon Salah being at 100 percent, but Egypt will be delighted with their group stage draw; even if they begin their campaign with a tough assignment against Uruguay, it shouldn't be too long before they get their first World Cup win. Russia and Saudi Arabia are the two lowest-ranked teams in the tournament, and while the former will be keen to leverage their home advantage, it's hard to see how either will have an answer to Salah. If the forward can summon up the inspiration that has accompanied him through his campaign with Liverpool, then Egypt could trouble either Portugal or Spain in the round of 16, but progress beyond that would represent a remarkable achievement."
Uruguay,"Uruguay finished second in the CONMEBOL qualifiers and had a great tournament despite Luis Suarez' absence from their first four matches and Edinson Cavani's absence in the first two. Uruguay's defensive intensity and ability to capitalize on the moments in which they manage to dominate their opponents have been their main virtues. They can rely on the strength of their backs, Diego Godin and Jose Maria Gimenez, who play together at Atletico Madrid. Uruguay's squad has also been revamped up the middle with young and intense players and have a devastating attack featuring one of the world's best duos in Suarez and Edinson Cavani. The overhaul in the middle has changed their play and the friendlies available to put this into practice have been limited. The intensity of the team is another point of concern. If Uruguay don't play to the maximum, they become vulnerable. Suarez, Godin and Cavani are the stars of the team. The defender holds the last line together while the forwards make up a fearsome offensive pair. One of them shines at Barcelona, the other one at PSG, and they complement each other wonderfully. Suarez has scored 50 goals in 97 matches and Cavani has scored 42 in 100. They both lead the national team in scoring. The media believes in this team. Since Tabarez took them on, they have improved their efficiency as the competition has progressed. They are in a group that is relatively easy for them and after that, the knockout stages, instances where Uruguay feel comfortable, will begin. Uruguay will get to Russia with an interesting mixture of experience and youth. Godin, Caceres, Suarez and Cavani are in excellent shape and they can count on sufficient depth in midfield. Winning the group will be key in order to start dreaming about the semifinals."
Portugal,"After losing the opening game of UEFA World Cup Qualification Group B against Switzerland in Basel, Portugal won all their remaining matches to top the group and qualify automatically for Russia. After that initial setback, which Ronaldo missed through injury, Portugal scored 32 goals and conceded only two in the next nine games. Ronaldo and Andre Silva struck up a superb partnership, scoring 24 goals between them. Santos has instilled an iron will to win and an enormous unity of purpose since taking over in September 2014, with the team winning 20 and losing only one of 24 competitive matches under the veteran coach. The Selecao regularly made deep runs into major tournaments in recent history -- five semifinals or better in nine tournaments this century -- but were always seen as mentally brittle at crunch time. Not anymore. Portugal's players have fully bought into the mantra of first and foremost making themselves difficult to beat, with the Euro 2016 triumph strengthening their belief in this approach and fortifying the newfound winning mentality. The fierce competition for places among a talented generation has not dented an impressive togetherness within the squad. A reliance on veteran players could prove their undoing. Portugal have lost only two competitive matches since the 2014 World Cup, and both times Ronaldo was missing through injury. If the opposition manage to nullify him, the Selecaowill struggle for goals. At the heart of defence, 35-year-old Pepe is arguably at least as important for Portugal's chances of going far, the form and fitness of the centre-back crucial, especially as he will likely be partnered by either Bruno Alves (36) or Jose Fonte (34), both of whose better days are behind them. As mentioned above, Portugal's traditional free-wheeling and flamboyant style of play has been replaced by a more defense-minded approach, meaning creativity is in short supply. Ricardo Quaresma (34), despite being mainly used off the bench by Santos, has supplied more than double the number of assists by any other Portugal player in the past four years, and is likely to be key to unlocking the opposition. Look no further than Portugal's greatest ever player, Cristiano Ronaldo. After a poor start to 2017-18, critics were lining up to write the obituaries on his extraordinary career. But since the turn of the year, the Real Madrid superstar has been unstoppable. He has obliterated the records for Portugal's national team (148 caps, 81 goals and counting) but remains as hungry as ever to further burnish his legacy. If the Selecao are to follow up their debut tournament victory in France two years ago with something special at this World Cup, Ronaldo will be at the heart of it.Portugal got drawn in one of the most difficult groups but have one of the top teams in the world right now so can aspire to the top. Although the other teams [Morocco and Iran] had fantastic qualifying campaigns, Portugal and Spain are favourites to top the group and are among the favourites to win the whole thing. At the start of the century, Portugal had more stars than they have now but didn't win anything. Now there are fewer stars, so you have to give credit to the job Fernando Santos has done, who has been extremely pragmatic in building a well-organised team. The two times Portugal qualified for a World Cup in Europe, they reached the semifinal (England 1966 and Germany 2006), but matching that achievement appears a long shot. An over-reliance on Ronaldo and Pepe, along with the fact that too many key players have had disastrous seasons -- Andre Silva, Raphael Guerreiro, Adrien Silva, Joao Mario -- has seen Portugal regress since winning the European Championship two years ago. They should get out of the group, and once there, a favourable match-up in the round of 16 makes a quarterfinal appearance doable, though the run will end there against France or Argentina."
Spain,"Spain sailed through qualifying in Europe's Group G, winning nine and drawing one of their 10 games while scoring 36 goals and conceding just three. Lopetegui also used the matches to blend new players, including Real Madrid's Marco Asensio and Atletico Madrid's Saul Niguez, with the experienced core he inherited two years ago from predecessor Vicente Del Bosque. The standout performance was in the clash with Italy in September at the Bernabeu, where Madrid's Isco scored twice in a comprehensive 3-0 victory. Spain's biggest strength throughout their 2008-12 glory years was a possession-based style that saw them able to dominate games and international tournaments in a way never seen before. Lopetegui has adopted that style to current conditions, renewing their vigour at pressing to regain the ball immediately when they lose it, but his team's chances of success in Russia will still be determined by whether they can again use possession to wear down opponents. Veteran midfielders Sergio Busquets, Andres Iniesta and David Silva will be key to this approach once more, and their experiences (both positive and negative) in previous tournaments should also be very useful in Russia. Spain's biggest problem through more recent disappointments has been a inability to turn all that dominance of territory and possession into goals. Lopetegui's side are almost sure to have the majority of the ball in all their games in Russia -- but not to make that advantage count. The ongoing lack of a confirmed first-choice centre-forward remains their biggest issue ahead of the tournament. Diego Costa, Alvaro Morata, Rodrigo Moreno and Iago Aspas have all played as the team's reference point in attack but all have questions over their suitability for the role. Marco Asensio was also tried as a ""false nine,"" something that could be repeated in the summer. Now 34, Andres Iniesta remains the leader in the Spain midfield, with Lopetegui trusting him as the successor to former teammate Xavi Hernandez as the team's main string-puller. The scorer of the winning goal at the 2010 tournament, Iniesta's ability to control the pace and shape of a game was seen again during a star showing as his club Barcelona won the 2018 Copa del Rey final in April. This is also sure to be a final international tournament for ""Don Andres,"" who will likely not play every single minute, but whose influence on and off the pitch will still be huge. A new team? No, it is still our old one; the one that Luis Aragones built, [Vicente] Del Bosque maintained for so long and which started to make incredible headway with a few replacement parts. Now it is Lopetegui's turn to replace a few bits and pieces, but the team remains the same. Lopetegui is doing an excellent job with tact, consideration and using the passage of time to his benefit. Spain is still producing players and he knows when to bring them in. The 3-0 victory over Italy in qualifying convinced fans and pundits that Spain were ""back"" and had a real chance of going all the way this year. Lopetegui's squad has at least as much talent and experience as any other country at the tournament, and if they do click, then they can potentially play at a level above all their potential opponents -- including Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal in the group and possibly Argentina in the quarterfinals and defending champions Germany in the semis. It has been a roller coaster for La Roja over the past decade, but they seem ready to peak again and send Iniesta, Ramos, Pique & Co. into international retirement with another winners' medal."
Morocco,"Despite being grouped with 2015 African champions Ivory Coast, Morocco went unbeaten during the CAF qualifying campaign and did not concede a goal across their six matches. But they started slowly, drawing three of their first four matches 0-0. The highlight of qualifying was a Hakim Ziyech-inspired 6-0 demolition of Mali in September, and they secured their spot in Russia by beating Gabon 3-0 in their penultimate game. Renard has demonstrated throughout his managerial career that he knows how to construct watertight defensive units, at least at the international level. The personnel at his disposal with the Atlas Lions has allowed him to build a side that concedes few goals. With Medhi Benatia in the centre of the defence, and Karim El Ahmadi protecting the back line, it will be fascinating to see how their Group B opponents try to break them down. Earlier in Renard's tenure, there were concerns about who could step up as the team's goal getter, but Khalid Boutaib came good with four during qualification, including a hat trick against Gabon, and will be a handful leading the line. Twelve goals in 29 appearances in the Turkish Super Lig this season is a decent return, too. Still, at 31, Boutaib is one of several key players -- along with Mbark Boussoufa, Karim El Ahmadi, Nordin Amrabat, Aziz Bouhaddouz, Nabil Dirar, Manuel da Costa and Medhi Benatia -- on the wrong side of 30, and it will be intriguing to see how well they can chase a game against Portugal or Spain if they fall behind. The biggest concern for Morocco is a particularly tricky draw which leaves them needing to pull off at least one big upset to progress. Hakim Ziyech appears primed for a big move this summer after another excellent season in the Eredivisie. He's been linked with a move to the Premier League in recent transfer windows -- Everton are his latest suitors -- and a strong tournament should see interest in his services increase. The Ajax midfielder has made 23 decisive contributions in the Dutch top flight so far this season (nine goals, 14 assists), and his showing in Morocco's 6-0 rout of Mali was arguably the best individual performance of any African player during the qualifying campaign.The Atlas Lions are ready! Mentally, physically, they know that they have all they need to win. They've qualified in heroic fashion, have touched all of the nation, and have capsized millions of hearts. Their togetherness, their courage and their ambition give them the right to dream. Thanks to Herve Renard, we can believe in qualification for the second round. The main quality I find in this team is its defensive solidity in the games that matter. Morocco finished first in their group without conceding, in a group containing Ivory Coast, Mali and Gabon [even if Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang didn't play every match]. It's a performance which demands respect. A team that didn't concede a single goal during qualification isn't going to be an easy team [to beat]. It's a squad where there's a blend of defensive solidity and experience, and which has a soul, and a coach who knows how to unite people around him. Had Morocco been drawn into Group A or H, where Egypt and Senegal landed, their fans would be expecting a spot in the knockout stages -- such is the superb organisation of this team and its wealth of options further forward. Had the Atlas Lions reached the final 16, then Renard's tactical acumen and track record in knockout football could have seen them take a further scalp or two. However, after being pitted against Portugal and Spain in Group B, it's hard to see them escaping the opening round. An opening-day win against Iran in St. Petersburg on June 15 is surely imperative, and after that they'll need to mastermind a victory over one of the two European heavyweights. It's a tall order, even if recent friendly victories over Uzbekistan and Serbia augur well."
Iran,"The road to Russia could not have been smoother and straighter for Iran, who became the second team (after Brazil) to secure a spot. All the team had to do was finish in the top two in the third round of qualification, and it was never in doubt. Not only did they finish first and unbeaten, but Iran, now preparing for a fifth World Cup, didn't concede a single goal until the 10th and final game after qualification had already been achieved. Iran's defence took the headlines in qualification, but what makes the difference between the team that finished bottom of their 2014 World Cup group and this version is the attacking options open to the coach Queiroz. Winger Alireza Jahanbakhsh and striker Sardar Azmoun would dribble and shoot their way into any Asian team, but there is more. Saman Ghoddos has enjoyed an excellent season in Sweden and is set for a move to a bigger league this summer, though he can't yet be sure of a starting place. Mehdi Taremi is one of the top strikers in Asia but could be on the bench, and the same can be said for Karim Ansarifard, the joint top scorer in the Greek league this season with a game remaining. There are others, and while Iran do like to keep things tight, their forays forward should be better -- in terms of quality and quantity -- than four years ago. Iran have been the highest-ranked Asian team for four years. That theoretical superiority has been reflected by reality for at least the past two years. The team has strength in depth, match-winners and match-savers and an excellent coach, but what it lacks is games against top-class international opposition. While qualification was impressive, Iran were not stretched enough by their continental counterparts. Preparations may be a little better than in the past, but the quality of opposition faced (Latvia, Uzbekistan and Sierra Leone) pales alongside the Belgium, Germany and Italy schedule regional rivals Saudi Arabia have lined up. The defence has been imperious in Asia but has not been tested as much as the coach may like. Alireza Jahanbakhsh. With one game of the Dutch Eredivisie season remaining, the winger -- that's right, the winger -- is the top scorer in the league. With 18 goals and a whole host of assists, the 24-year-old has been one of the top performers in Europe this season. In 2014, Team Melli defended with diligence and discipline at the 2014 World Cup but just managed a single goal in 270 minutes of football. There are more offensive weapons at Queiroz's disposal now with the AZ Alkmaar attacker in excellent form (though pastures new are surely just around the corner). He's fast and direct, and with confidence sky-high, he's ready to shoot powerfully from anywhere. The most exciting thought is that there are other dangers such as Azmoun for defenders to worry about, which gives Jahanbakhsh the freedom to do what he does best: cause havoc. For Iran to proceed from the group will be very difficult because Spain and Portugal are top teams but it will not be an easy task for them to beat Iran. Team Melli will make Iran proud. We want to write our own history and book a place in the second round for the first time. We firmly believe that we can do it because we have the potential. After an almost perfect qualification campaign and a feeling that things were really coming together to make a first knockout-stage appearance a real possibility, the draw was cruel. But if any Asian team can get out of it, it is Iran. Morocco will be far from easy, but three points from the opening game puts Team Melli within touching distance. There is no doubt Iran are capable of getting a result against Spain and/or Portugal, and it is fair to say Queiroz, former coach of Real Madrid and Portugal, is going to know more about the opposition than vice-versa. Given the draw, as well as Iran's past history in the tournament, there are no demands to finish in the top two. Being in the mix for the final game would be acceptable, and their statistic of just one win in 12 previous World Cup matches really needs to be improved. Yet if Iran can make it out of the group, there is no reason why they could not go a little further."
France,"The French team topped Europe's Group B, which featured Netherlands and Sweden, but qualification was closer than expected. Deschamps' men finished four points ahead of both the Dutch and the Swedes, losing to Janne Andersson's side away and also dropping points against Belarus and Luxembourg. A maximum points haul was not expected, but it was feasible, so the loss in Sweden and the home draw with Luxembourg was disappointing. A maximum points haul was not expected, but it was feasible, so the loss in Sweden and the home draw with Luxembourg was disappointing. France boast an abundance of young talent and strength (not to mention quality) in depth that almost every other nation can only dream of. With the exception of a few select positions, notably left-back and right-back, Deschamps has an enviable array of proven star quality or exceptional promise to choose from. The 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship-winning captain is going to have a stronger headache than most in deciding who to leave behind this summer. Les Bleus have started to believe their own hype, and as history will attest, that is not a good thing. Back in 2013, France rode the crest of a wave of national unity as the nation fell back in love with their footballers after a lengthy period of turmoil to reach the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. That ""feel-good"" factor carried over into Euro 2016 on home soil but has since worn off. Deschamps, who has had his contract renewed until 2020, has come in for criticism for not getting better out of this squad, while big stars like Manchester United's Paul Pogba have been accused of not doing enough for the team. This summer in Russia will be critical for the current French generation. Despite boasting the likes of Pogba and Paris Saint-Germain's Kylian Mbappe, Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann remains France's talisman. However, Griezmann is not immune to the issues currently ailing Deschamps' squad, and his return of four goals from 10 qualification appearances reflected the nation's bumpy road to Russia. Pogba and Griezmann are viewed as the strong men of this team. The other players are proud to play alongside these guys. Pogba and Griezmann do not seem to understand that, though. They are both rappers, actors, directors, dancers, footballers and basketball players at the same time: Griezmann has even said he would prefer to play basketball! A few months before a World Cup, they need to be concentrating. They have to lead the way! They cannot be asking journalists to ""get behind us and push us higher"" or ""get behind Grizou and take him higher."" What is this c--p? It is up to them to take us, the nation, there! This French team lacks character and mentality. France should top Group C ahead of Australia, Denmark and Peru but find things harder in the latter stages. Argentina, Croatia, Iceland and Nigeria are all possibilities in the round of 16, while Portugal, Spain, Russia, Uruguay and Egypt could all follow in the quarterfinals. Les Bleus will probably reach the last eight, but going further than that will require a significant change in attitude. Perhaps the the tournament will bring exactly that, making the semifinals a distinct possibility."
Australia,"The Socceroos qualified the hard way after finishing third behind Japan and Saudi Arabia in Group B of Asia's third qualification round. Two-legged playoffs against Syria and Honduras followed, and success in these crunch games secured Australia a berth in a fourth consecutive World Cup. Immediately after booking their place, though, coach Ange Postecoglou announced his resignation. Attacking at all costs saw the Socceroos enjoy unprecedented success under the guidance of Postecoglou, and that attitude is almost certain to prevail for the foreseeable future, including when the team takes to the pitch in Russia. That will be mildly tempered by short-term boss Bert van Marwijk, who will insist his midfield and defence clamp down on the opposition. So, all going to plan for the Socceroos, the balance of the side should be its greatest strength. This strategy also plays to the strengths of the personnel at Van Marwijk's disposal, with key midfielders Aaron Mooy, Massimo Luongo and Tom Rogic all capable of becoming the fulcrum of the team at any moment. Losing an influential coach is always difficult, but when a side is only months out from the biggest competition of all, that loss is felt even deeper. The Socceroos players will not come out publicly to acknowledge the hole that is Postecoglou's absence, but they will know he should be there with them. That sense of something missing will likely linger in the dressing room, particularly at the start of the tournament. That said, a strong early showing against France in their opener in Kazan could erase many of those feelings, giving the players greater faith in Van Marwijk -- despite his confirmed short tenure. Aaron Mooy has all the skills needed to make a big name for himself at the World Cup. Already performing solidly in the Premier League for Huddersfield Town, Mooy is strong in the tackle and capable of playing a killer ball in an instant. Indeed, his ability to turn defence into attack swiftly could hold the key to Australia surprising their more fancied Group C opponents. He will need to be at his absolute best to give the Socceroos a fighting chance of sneaking into the round of 16 and, if he is, it would not surprise to see the 27-year-old land a transfer to a bigger club next season. The 4-1 loss to Norway, followed by the 0-0 draw with Colombia, exposed the teething problems that need to be quickly fixed before Russia, and while a player like Massimo Luongo put his credentials front and centre, others, particularly defensively, will make the new Dutch mentor look closely at other options floating around Australia and the football globe. Expectations are relatively low given the managerial change and tricky group opponents in France, Denmark and Peru. In fact, very few people will give Australia a chance of progressing beyond the group stage. However, with more familiarity of van Marwijk's game plan in upcoming friendlies, this team will certainly fight until the bitter end. If they can become difficult enough to break down in defence, they may just eke out one or two positive results. There is no doubt that it'll be difficult for Australia to finish in the top two of Group C, but in one of the most evenly balanced World Cup draws in recent memory, it's not entirely implausible."
Peru,"Peru went from an awful start to an awesome finish in CONMEBOL qualifying as a late run of form allowed them to return to the World Cup after a 36-year absence. After seven games they had managed only four points, and with only five games left they were stuck in eighth place out of 10 teams. The arrival of Gareca took some time to produce results, but officials were wise enough to support the coach, who was eager to give chances to several local, promising players. Gareca finally found a nice blend between youth and experience and the team started producing results. In fact, Peru hasn't lost a match in over a year-and-a-half. Their last defeat was a 2-0 loss against Brazil in November 2016. Since then they have gone undefeated in 12 matches. The Court of Arbitration for Sport's ruling against Bolivia for fielding an ineligible player against Chile and Peru gave both teams points they had not won on the field and encouraged La Blanquirroja to keep fighting for a World Cup berth. In the process, they achieved historic results, such as first-time away wins in Paraguay and in Quito against Ecuador. A final-round draw against Colombia saw them clinch the fifth spot and a ticket to play an intercontinental playoff, in which they were much better than New Zealand and sealed their World Cup return. Peru became a dangerous team by means of their defensive consistency. As a result of strong confidence in their back line, the team started breaking free and venturing forward, becoming very efficient and effective in front of goal. Their third virtue is of a more emotional nature: they are a close-knit group that resembles a family. Without a doubt, this group's weak point is its lack of World Cup experience. Not even their manager has attended the competition, though he came close as a player to being a member of the Argentina national team that won the World Cup in Mexico 1986. Gareca was part of the squad that played the qualification matches; weirdly, he scored a decisive goal in the last round as Argentina made it to the World Cup with a 2-2 tie against ... Peru. As far as the game goes, Peru has always suffered from set play, although they look a lot stronger in this area this time around. Now that he is available again, Guerrero is Peru's main man. The 34-year-old was to have missed the trip to Russia after being suspended for six months by the CAS due to a positive doping test, but his clearance provides a boost. Guerrero scored five goals in qualifying and has a national-team record 34 overall for Peru. Beyond him, the attacking responsibility falls to one of his best friends and the player behind him in that scoring chart, Jefferson Farfan. The Peruvian media feels euphoric. A lot of us haven't ever seen Peru in a World Cup, and the truth is that our love for the national team has been fed mostly by defeats. Every single conversation in the street lands on the World Cup sooner or later. The media and the fans are confident and grateful for what the manager has achieved; both him and the team can count on massive support. Peru should take this World Cup step by step, and their objective should be to get to the round of 16: From that moment on, anything can happen. If Peru get wins against Denmark and Australia, they should end the group stage in second place behind France. After that, logic says Argentina would follow, a very difficult rival and a hard-fought match."
Denmark,"Hareide's side finished five points behind Group E winners Poland, meaning victory in a playoff with the Republic of Ireland was required to send them to Russia. They had mixed cause for optimism: A home defeat to Montenegro had boded ill early in the qualifying campaign, but it was followed last September by a resounding 4-0 win over the Poles. In the playoff, Denmark took the latter course against Ireland. A goalless draw in Copenhagen left all to play for in the second leg, where they proceeded to stun a fervent Dublin crowd by winning 5-1. Few could have seen that coming after Shane Duffy scored early on for the hosts, but Denmark's recovery, led by a thrilling Christian Eriksen hat trick, was remarkable and sent them to the World Cup on an unexpected high. Denmark are powerful, organised and relatively direct, using the height of the 6-foot-3 Nicolai Jorgensen up front to good advantage and sometimes fielding Andreas Cornelius, who stands at 6-foot-4, wide on the right. There is plenty of size and strength elsewhere in the team, with 6-footers Thomas Delaney and William Kvist an industrious pair in central midfield, while captain Simon Kjaer, of Sevilla, is a hugely experienced centre-back. In 12 qualifying games, including the playoffs, they conceded only nine goals. Yet they are hardly a team of long ball merchants and perhaps their greatest quality is the way in which they can mix things up: They have fine technical players such as Eriksen and winger Pione Sisto and are just as capable of prising teams open on the ground. There are obvious issues at full-back, where Hareide is struggling to settle on a convincing pairing. The left-back spot is a particular concern: Jens Stryger Larsen of Udinese operated there during the playoffs in the absence of Riza Durmisi, who was injured, but Nicolai Boilesen is also an option, and Ipswich's Jonas Knudsen was given the shirt in March's goalless draw with Chile. There is no stand-out contender for the role, and there is a dilemma at right-back, too. Andreas Christensen filled in during the second leg against Ireland to good effect but is a central defender by trade, and there is a risk Hareide may try too hard to shoehorn him in. Stryger Larsen could move to his favoured position, while Peter Ankersen and Henrik Dalsgaard are also tried-and-tested options, but the solution is not yet clear. Another common gripe is that Kvist and Delaney are not a combination given to moving the ball smoothly enough between defence and attack. Christian Eriksen is the man who lifts Denmark above the mean. He is one of the best playmakers in world football and the man who will be relied on heavily if they are to advance far this summer. He operates in the No. 10 position for Hareide and was near-unstoppable in the qualifiers, scoring eight times even before that unforgettable occasion in Dublin. Hareide called him ""an inspiration to those around him, a world-class player"" after his hat trick, and it is true that when Eriksen is on song, Denmark invariably are, too. While the emergence of Sisto -- the 23-year-old Celta Vigo player is a fine talent and scored the winner against Panama in March -- is welcome, there is nobody else who can don Eriksen's mantle right now. Several Danish experts have predicted that Hareide's players have a great opportunity to earn second place in the group. Group C might be more open than it looks with France clearly vulnerable, but Denmark are likely to battle it out with Peru for second place. Their experience -- and Eriksen -- will see them through, but it is hard to see them going beyond the last 16."
Argentina,"Though Argentina finished third in CONMEBOL qualifying, the road to get there was full of bumps. Namely, unexpected defeats at home against Ecuador and Paraguay, a draw against Venezuela, a hard 3-0 loss when visiting Brazil and three different managers (Gerardo ""Tata"" Martino, Edgardo Bauza and Jorge Sampaoli). To make matters worse, Lionel Messi's absence from several matches confirmed once more that the team relies unconditionally on his participation. In fact, it wasn't until the captain's hat trick in the final qualifier against Ecuador in Quito that Argentina finally found a sense of calm and secured qualification.

To make matters worse, Lionel Messi's absence from several matches confirmed once more that the team relies unconditionally on his participation. In fact, it wasn't until the captain's hat trick in the final qualifier against Ecuador in Quito that Argentina finally found a sense of calm and secured qualification. The mental aspect and their will to end their drought are also very important factors in the face of the last chance several members of the squad will have to finally win a major tournament.Besides having the best player in the whole world, Argentina boast a plethora of other offensive players who are able to disrupt opponents with ease. Even though they are part of the group that has been harshly criticized after their losses in the finals, the credentials of players such as Angel Di Maria, Sergio Aguero and Gonzalo Higuain, just to name some forwards who excel in Europe, are undeniable. If they are on and if they finally understand how to play around Messi, the Albiceleste should feel enthusiastic. A few days prior to Russia 2018, nobody knows who will play in the key positions. This, in part, is because Sampaoli has tried different names and systems but is also due to injuries suffered by several key members of the team. The constant swaps by the manager, with very different styles and formations, had a negative impact on the team. Lucas Biglia and Aguero, undisputed starters for Sampaoli, will arrive in Russia with little playing time. Ramiro Funes Mori and Marcos Rojo, formerly irremovable in defense, have both been sidelined for extended periods. In midfield, there are more doubts than certainties. Until the World Cup starts, the real state of this team remains unknown. By the way, Argentina were badly beaten by Spain (6-1) in their last friendly match. What can we say about Lionel Messi that hasn't already been said? In addition to his great season with Barcelona, leading Barca to the Copa Del Rey and La Liga titles, he has been resting in order to face his main challenge: the World Cup. When he announced his exit from the national team after the loss in the Copa America Centenario 2016, a general cry for his return was massively heard. Luckily, he ended up changing his mind and has become, once more, the face of the Argentine team. Heading into Russia 2018, Argentina's hopes rest heavily on the shoulders of their No. 10, captain and superstar. Argentina will be World Cup champions, guided by Lionel Messi, the best player in the history of the game. A good 99 percent of predictions are useless when talking about a World Cup. There could be as many as seven games in a month and the truth is that anything can happen. The draw left Argentina in Group D, with surprising Iceland, dangerous Croatia and a very familiar face in Nigeria. It won't be easy but Argentina are the favorite to win the group. If things happen as expected, the team should advance to the round of 16 and then, to the quarterfinals. But unlike in Brazil 2014, where the path to the finals was relatively easy, in Russia the Albiceleste could end up facing Spain, Brazil and Germany once more. Messi and co already know this: this time around, they have to become the champions."
Iceland,"Iceland finished top of a keenly contested Group I in UEFA qualifying, therefore progressing to Russia automatically. A playoff place looked their most realistic hope until the penultimate matchday, when they secured a stunning 3-0 win in Turkey and left the pitch to find Finland had improbably equalised against Croatia. It left a previously tight group wide open for them to qualify with a 2-0 win over Kosovo three days later. An experienced, remarkably tight-knit squad blends a formidable work ethic with seemingly boundless self-belief. Iceland would never claim to have the world's best players, but many of Hallgrimsson's side have developed together and have complete faith in each. At international level, it is a rare quality; essentially, they have the togetherness of a club side, and it means that even when situations seem to be working against them, nobody loses their head. They have plenty more going for them: While they became known for their physical, direct style at Euro 2016, they have more technical qualities than they are given credit for -- and Hallgrimsson has introduced a new level of tactical flexibility, too. If World Cups were won purely on spirit, then Iceland would be front-runners, but they are unlikely to have the depth of quality for a run far beyond the group stage. They need everyone fit to have a chance, and there have been a number of worries leading up to the tournament, inconveniently regarding their most important attackers. Gylfi Sigurdsson will only just be back from a knee injury and possibly not match-fit, while their Euro 2016 centre-forward Kolbeinn Sigthorsson will probably miss out having barely kicked a ball since sustaining a medial meniscus injury in September 2016. Alfred Finnbogason, another key forward, has also struggled for fitness. Iceland need at least two of them available and also hope their captain, Aron Gunnarsson, recovers from a knee injury in good time -- but fitness is not the only issue. A lack of pace across the side, particularly in defence, is particular drawback that will be hard to address before the World Cup. There is no doubt about it: Gylfi Sigurdsson has star quality, and even if this has been an underwhelming campaign after his big-money move to Everton, he's the man Iceland know can add inspiration to buckets of sweat. He proved it in the decisive Kosovo game, seizing upon an error to put them ahead shortly before half-time, when nerves were clearly telling elsewhere. He also scored two vital qualifying goals against Ukraine. In total, he has found the net 18 times for his country, but his wider contribution is worth even more. If he is healthy in Russia, Iceland have a player who can turn games from nowhere; without him, their job would look considerably harder. I have to believe in the team and believe in going through; this is probably the most difficult draw we could get Iceland will put up an almighty scrap yet again, but fitness issues surrounding key players are a big concern, and they will fall just short of progressing from the World Cup's tightest group."
Croatia,"Croatia had significant problems in UEFA Group I, and managed to secure second place behind Iceland on the last matchday thanks to the 2-0 win in Ukraine The federation decided to fire the coach, Ante Cacic, just a few days previously, following the sensational 1-1 draw at home with Finland, and named the little-known Dalic as his replacement. Dalic eventually managed to lead the team to a 4-1 aggregate win over Greece in the playoffs, but the general feeling was that Croatia should have made the qualification process much easier. Losses in Iceland and in Turkey left a sour taste, and the Croats managed to score only 15 goals in 10 group fixtures. To put it simply, Croatia possess some of the best midfield options in the world. In Real Madrid's Modric and Mateo Kovacic, Barcelona's Ivan Rakitic and Inter Milan's Ivan Perisic and Marcelo Brozovic, they can rely on true world-class performers in this area and this is the core of their team. Add quality up front in Juventus' Mario Mandzukic, Milan's Nikola Kalinic and Hoffenheim's Andrej Kramaric, and you get a magnificent lineup that is capable of beating any team on their day. Indeed, Croatia deservedly won against Spain at Euro 2016, and they will never feel inferior against any rivals. Most of the players are experienced at the big stage as well because they play for top teams in the best leagues. They won't be overwhelmed at the World Cup. Attitude is the biggest problem Croatia are expected to face, and we are not talking about the players. Anonymous coaches appointed in recent years (first Cacic and now Dalic) are seen as puppets who don't make decisions themselves, and it is unclear whether the stars can respect them. Dalic is very inexperienced and has already proved to be nervous under pressure. The media atmosphere surrounding the team is usually quite problematic, and it could hurt the nation's chances. On the pitch, defence is the weakest link, as Dejan Lovren, Domagoj Vida and Sime Vrsaljko are all error-prone, whereas 32-year-old Vedran Corluka has only recently recovered from a serious knee injury. Luka Modric is one of the very top midfielders of his generation and this could be the last World Cup for the 32-year-old superstar. Visionary and technically sublime, the captain is the ultimate playmaker for Croatia, and the game tends to go through him, especially when he is on song. We have quite a few big names in the squad. Those guys represent top clubs, and they are experienced playing together for the national team. The 2018 World Cup is the last chance for this extraordinary generation, which is the finest the country had produced since the bronze-winning heroes of 1998. Taking talent into account, they could possibly go far, but on the other hand they still don't have an established style that would make the team more than just a sum of individual parts. A positive atmosphere within the squad and a coach who is respected are crucial to success. Croatia lack those specific ingredients and they are in a very tough group with Argentina, Iceland and Nigeria. In fact, Iceland managed to finish ahead of them in their UEFA qualifying group and it is likely to happen again on the big stage. The potential is remarkable, but if one has to make a prediction, one could see a group stage exit. "
Nigeria,"Despite being drawn in a group alongside Algeria, Zambia and African champions Cameroon, Nigeria made light work of their opponents and qualified with 14 points. It would have been more had their final match not been awarded to the Algerians after the Super Eagles fielded an ineligible player, although that administrative misdemeanour couldn't overshadow memories of convincing victories over the Indomitable Lions and the Fennecs. Beyond securing the Eagles' spot in Russia, the qualifying campaign also served to restore the nation's belief in the team and herald in Gernot Rohr's new era. There's on-field strength across the park, with every area apart from goalkeeper and arguably centre-forward stocked with options. However, perhaps the Super Eagles' key asset is the unity, morale and belief of this group of players. Rohr has overlooked many of the underachievers of previous regimes and placed his faith in youngsters, many of whom have stepped up seamlessly to the international arena. The likes of Alex Iwobi, Kelechi Iheanacho and Wilfred Ndidi marry youthful exuberance with the mentality required to succeed in the Premier League, and Nigeria have enjoyed a largely serene buildup to the World Cup. Goalkeeper remains a concern for Rohr following Vincent Enyeama's departure from the international scene and Carl Ikeme's leukemia diagnosis. The coach appears to have lost faith in his initial go-to stopper, Ikechukwu Ezenwa, and plumped for 19-year-old Francis Uzoho to start between the sticks in Nigeria's recent friendlies. The youngster overcame a nervy start to keep Robert Lewandowski at bay as Poland were beaten, but with only 180 minutes of La Liga football under his belt with Deportivo La Coruna, the inexperienced Uzoho is in danger of being exposed in Russia. John Obi Mikel remains the Super Eagles' talisman, even if Iwobi and Victor Moses may make more eye-catching contributions. The central midfielder offers terrific experience, having won the Champions League, the Europa League, the African Cup of Nations and two Premier League titles, and is considered something of a father figure by the squad's new blood. If the Super Eagles are under pressure, he plays a key role in controlling the tempo, retaining possession and ensuring the side maintain their structure. And as he has demonstrated in the Chinese Super League so far this term, he remains capable of making a decisive impact in the final third as well. This team remains inordinately reliant on its spine of Leon Balogun, John Obi Mikel and Victor Moses. That in itself is not a bad thing. Every team has a spine to build upon. However, what is increasingly glaring is that the level of the side without them does not so much depreciate as it does disappear altogether. It is one thing to go from a good side to a not-so-good side, and quite another to go from a good side to a turgid, bereft one. There was optimism in Nigeria after the World Cup draw was revealed, with Super Eagles fans boosted by a recent friendly victory over Argentina after being paired once again with the Albicelestes. However, the West Africans must play well to escape the first round, with Croatia and Iceland completing a tricky group that will take some negotiating. A recent friendly defeat by Serbia should help the Eagles come back down to earth, but while that loss may refocus attention on the squad's deficiencies, the goalkeeping issue continues to cast a long shadow and may yet destabilise the team in Russia."
Brazil,"Qualification began when Dunga was coach, and Brazil were not playing good soccer. When the coach was sacked, the team was in sixth place and at risk of not making it to Russia. The arrival of Tite completely changed the scenario. Players recovered their form, rivals started to fear them again and the good results poured in. Brazil became the first national team (after the hosts) to secure its place in the World Cup, finishing top of the South American qualifiers. Brazil's greatest quality is the fact the team doesn't rely on Neymar as heavily as in the 2014 World Cup, when its game depended on the player's individual moves. Brazil's greatest quality is the fact the team doesn't rely on Neymar as heavily as in the 2014 World Cup, when its game depended on the player's individual moves. This change became clear from the moment Tite took over the national team. With a new coach and a new game, Neymar was given more freedom to play and the team became an actual team. The mixture has resulted in something interesting. There are familiar faces (Dani Alves and Marcelo), new assets (Casemiro and Gabriel Alves) and athletes who have emerged across the European soccer scene (Philippe Coutinho and Willian). This is a team that knows how to pass the ball, how to attack and also how to defend. And Neymar is the cherry on top. It is hard to talk about weaknesses when you have a balanced team. They do exist, though. There are three points to focus on here, and the first one is tactical. Dani Alves and Marcelo are wingers with attacking abilities who like to play forward and are essential in making things happen. Therefore, extra caution is required for these spaces not to be explored by the opposition. Second is experience, not in terms of each player but the team itself up against elite rivals. Brazilian players under Tite's command had few tests against the top teams on the planet. Will this matter at the World Cup? Maybe. Third is Neymar. His foot injury has left him out of the game since Feb. 26. How will he be after all this time off the pitch? Again, Brazil don't rely only on him, but the thought of playing without their star is, to say the least, worrying. All the spotlights will be fixed on Neymar. In 2010, the then-wannabe star was out of the call-up. The early elimination against the Netherlands left a question: would it have been different with him on the field? A star in 2014, he saw his World Cup end in an injury against Colombia and witnessed from afar the 7-1 Brazilian defeat against Germany. The question remains: would it have been different with Neymar in the pitch? We will never know. Two years later, Neymar was the star of the gold-medal team in the Olympic Games of Rio de Janeiro, an achievement yet to be conquered then in the trophy-riddled room of the Brazilian national team. Now it is going to be the showdown. There are still doubts; after all, Neymar hasn't played since February and there is no knowing how he will come back. Regardless, he is the top player of the top national team in the planet. Everyone wants to see Neymar play. Even Neymar himself. Brazil is among the favorites to the World Cup title. With Tite, the national team became strong collectively and has potentialized individual talents. Tite's taking over the national team has brought new stamina to the players, to the federation, and mostly, to the fans, who had lost their faith in the soccer played by the national team. Neymar's injury, however, raises a major interrogation mark. If the PSG star comes back to the pitch with limitations, Brazilian hopes to get the sixth title decrease. However, if the No. 10-shirt ace comes back 'in one piece,' the cup gets closer. The 7-1 result still echoes in our heads. And to erase what happened in 2014, there is only one remedy: the title. A beautiful game might be put aside in favor of results, and that is what the fans want. Can Brazil be the champion? Yes. Do they have the team for that? Yes. It doesn't even occur to many Brazilian fans that the World Cup can end before the final. And while losing the title would not be a disaster as long as the team shows the will to win, winning the competition would mean redemption."
Switzerland,"It ended up being the tightest of squeezes for Switzerland, who edged past Northern Ireland in the play-offs with a 1-0 aggregate win thanks to Ricardo Rodriguez's first-leg penalty. The award of that spot-kick was furiously contested, too: it was given for handball by the home side's Corry Evans when the ball had in fact struck his shoulder. In fairness, Switzerland had ranked highest of the nine second-placed sides in the group stage and were almost unstoppable in the group stage. They entered their final Group B match, in Portugal, with a 100 percent record and had caught the European champions cold with a 2-0 home win early on. But Portugal won all their subsequent games in an otherwise weak group, meaning Switzerland would have to settle for the play-offs if they lost in Lisbon. The Euro 2016 champions avenged that earlier two-goal defeat and progressed; fortunately Switzerland followed them even if it took a slice of luck. The flanks are Switzerland's most obvious strong point. Serie A pair Stephan Lichtsteiner (the captain) and Rodriguez are both outstanding players and support attacks unstintingly even though the former is now 34. Rodriguez, of AC Milan, has an exceptional left foot that poses a considerable threat both from set pieces and open play. There is good depth, too: should anything happen to Lichtsteiner then Basel right-back, Michael Lang -- who scored winners against both Manchester United and Manchester City in this season's Champions League -- is no mean deputy. The full-backs combine well with some exciting options further forward: Xherdan Shaqiri will probably start on the right while Hoffenheim's Steven Zuber is a danger on the opposite flank. An exciting alternative is Basel loanee Dimitri Oberlin, just 20, who received his first national team call-up in March and is blessed with frightening pace. Where will the goals come from? Switzerland's centre-forward options have largely fallen short in major tournaments but they look likely to start with Haris Seferovic, who hasn't pulled any trees up with Benfica this season, leading the line again. Seferovic did score a winner against Ecuador at the 2014 World Cup but drew a blank at Euro 2016 and falls short of the quality needed to provide a reliable cutting edge. Josip Drmic, of Borussia Monchengladbach, is a more natural finisher but has played little football this season while Breel Embolo -- still a huge prospect at 21 years old -- has had a difficult season with Schalke and is yet to hit consistent form. Mario Gavranovic, who plays in Croatia for Dinamo Zagreb, is the only striker scoring consistently but there is no real indication that he can make the difference at a World Cup. Attacking midfielders are arguably the most valuable players in football these days and Switzerland's fortunes in Russia may depend directly on how well Xherdan Shaqiri fares. It has been a difficult season domestically for the Stoke schemer, due to their relegation from the Premier League rather than any particularly poor personal form, and he will need to clear his head quickly. It is startling to remember that Shaqiri, who had won 68 caps before the pre-tournament friendlies, is still just 26: he has been his country's most important creative force this decade and has delivered at major competitions before, memorably scoring a stunning bicycle kick from 18 yards in the Euro 2016 draw with Poland. More of the same will be needed in a side that, while capable of playing attractive football and possessing a range of attacking options, lacks genuine top-drawer talent elsewhere. Shaqiri, who would do his hopes of joining a bigger club next season no harm with a strong World Cup display, could hold the key to a successful tournament. Costa Rica and Serbia are two teams we can defeat... and if everything goes to plan, then we would probably meet Germany in the round of 16. Switzerland's second game, against Serbia, already has a ""showdown"" sort of feel to it. The battle will probably go to the wire but Petkovic's team will fall just short of the runners-up spot and that likely clash with the Germans."
Costa_Rica,"Costa Rica won their group with 16 points to advance to CONCACAF's Hexagonal phase. In their first game of the round they defeated Trinidad & Tobago, and days later scored a resounding 4-0 win over the United States. La Sele's first loss came in their next game against Mexico, and they earned just two points in ensuing draws against Honduras and Panama. But in their final five games of the Hexagonal, Costa Rica again defeated Trinidad & Tobago and the U.S., virtually punching their ticket to Russia. The Ticos finished in second place with 16 points despite not winning any of their last three games in the final round. Defense, first and foremost. Costa Rica had the second-best unit of the Hexagonal, allowing just eight goals. Centre-backs Kendall Waston, Giancarlo Gonzalez and Johnny Acosta showed a good level of play throughout the qualifying round. And the case could be made that the true strength of Oscar Ramirez's back half lies in his ""wall,"" as Keylor Navas is considered one of the world's best goalkeepers. There is a consensus that, despite the 14 qualifying goals, Costa Rica need a natural centre-forward. Betis' Joel Campbell just returned to action in Spain after rehabbing an injury, and Marco Urena of Major League Soccer's LAFC underwent surgery to repair broken bones in his face sustained in an April collision. Both strikers risk arriving in Russia with some rust to knock off. Keylor Navas, without question. Real Madrid's keeper is also the leader of the Costa Rican side, and any shot at advancing out of the group stage will be tied to his performances. A good showing in the Champions League final with Real could result in some momentum. The Ticos' biggest accomplishment is being among the 32 teams that will participate in the tournament, since almost nobody in Costa Rica can imagine repeating the feat from four years ago: Losing on penalty kicks to Holland in the quarterfinals. Costa Rica sit in Group E with Brazil, Serbia and Switzerland. On paper, Brazil are virtually assured a berth in the round of 16. The Ticos will be contenders for the second spot, but if they wish to advance it's imperative they win their matchups against Switzerland and Serbia. In case Costa Rica reach the knockout stage, they could face defending champion Germany or CONCACAF rival Mexico."
Serbia,"Topping Group D in the UEFA qualifiers was no mean achievement for Serbia, but it caused surprisingly little fanfare at home. Their place at Russia 2018 was confirmed with a 1-0 home win over Georgia, but the celebrations were relatively muted, perhaps because disappointment still lingered at a late 3-2 defeat in Austria three days earlier. Qualifying in such serene fashion had seemed a tall order at the outset, though, with Wales and the Republic of Ireland joining the Austrians in the group. Serbia were consistent throughout, and an ultimately decisive moment came in September 2017, when Kolarov's goal gave them a 1-0 win in Dublin. There were only two games left to play after that; Serbia finished the job, although that was not enough to save their manager, Slavoljub Muslin, from being sacked. If Serbia can fine-tune it in time, they have a midfield that can match up to almost any in Russia. The steel and composure of Nemanja Matic need little introduction, and Luka Milivojevic has had a fine season with Crystal Palace; if Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, the prodigious Lazio playmaker, can be bedded in alongside them, it comes close to the complete package. A failure to accommodate Milinkovic-Savic in the qualifiers was largely what accounted for Muslin's dismissal; he was swiftly called up to face South Korea and China in November but missed the March friendlies through injury. Even if he does not start Serbia's opening game against Costa Rica, there is plenty of hope elsewhere. This is a technically gifted side that can be lethal on the counter and should not lack creativity. Serbia has punched spectacularly above its weight in terms of player production for many years and the sense has long persisted that the national team is less than the sum of its parts. They looked far more cohesive -- not to mention motivated -- in qualifying, but there are still areas of doubt. Pace is lacking in a defence that has long been marshalled by Branislav Ivanovic, 34, while Kolarov and Antonio Rukavina, their full-backs, are aging, too. Ivanovic's place may yet be in doubt, with Krstajic relieving him of the captaincy in March and noting that ""no one can take a spot in the 23-man spot for granted."" The manager prefers a four-man back line to the 3-4-3 system deployed by Muslin and the system may not be perfected by mid-June. More broadly, Serbia can find it hard to sustain a high tempo for 90 minutes; they have a habit of switching off at key moments and will need to address that if they are to make it through the group stage. Aleksandar Mitrovic enters this tournament in devastating form. There was never any doubt about the centre-forward's importance to the national team -- he scored six goals in qualifying -- but his Premier League opportunities at Newcastle United were limited and a loan move to Championship promotion hopefuls Fulham looked an unwelcome step back. But Mitrovic was electric at club level during the second half of the campaign, breaking off to score twice in Serbia's 2-0 win over Nigeria, and he showed that with creative players behind him, he is still one of Europe's most interesting young striking prospects. He is still just 23 and has plenty of scope to improve; he currently seems to be in the best shape of his career and the natural choice to lead the line for a Serbia side whose attacking play has improved considerably in the past two years. Mitrovic would be hard to replace in the event of injury, although Milinkovic-Savic stands to be similarly influential if he is successfully accommodated in the starting lineup. Brazil is the world's most sophisticated selection and will be favourite for first place in the group. ... [It] is realistic to expect the Eagles to fight for the second stage with the Costa Ricans and the Swiss. The smart money is on a jostle for second place with a Switzerland side that has more tournament experience. Serbia will pip them to the round of 16 but, with Germany their likely opponents at that stage, further progress looks to be a long shot."
Germany,"World Cup holders Germany were never in danger of not qualifying for Russia. Low's men finished Group C with a 100 percent record, beating Northern Ireland, Czech Republic, Norway, Azerbaijan and San Marino at home and away. They conceded only four goals and scored 43: the highest total in all European groups alongside Belgium. Germany were in control of their group from the outset and also found the energy to win the 2017 Confederations Cup with an inexperienced ""B squad."" Future Bayern Munich midfielder Leon Goretzka in particular impressed as he announced himself on the world stage. One again going to the World Cup without a star player, Germany's biggest strength has always been the team spirit, the idea that a strong group of players will always be superior to individual talents -- and they have such squad depth they've been able to leave Manchester City's Leroy Sane behind. With most players available for the training camp after the Bundesliga's plight in Europe, Low will be able to work on ideas for the big games in the knockout stages. Backed by one of the most advanced data systems in world football, they will not only develop strategies for both attack and defence but also continue to improve their set-piece tactics. At the 2014 World Cup, Germany scored five goals from set pieces -- more than any other nation. Although they're not overly reliant on individuals, the possible loss of goalkeeper Neuer could turn into a problem. Redefining goalkeeping at the 2014 World Cup, especially in the round-of-16 match against Algeria, the Bayern and Germany captain has not played a minute of football since September. He hopes to be fit in time for the opening match, but doubts over his fitness and his confidence in his body will remain. Barcelona's Marc-Andre ter Stegen, the backup solution, is a very good option, but Neuer still ranks above him. The goalkeeper spot could become Low's catch-22. Toni Kroos has been the unsung hero of the Germany team for many years now. The Real Madrid player has played in seven consecutive Champions League semifinals for Bayern Munich and the Spanish giants, whom he joined in 2014. He dominates midfield, and his calm distribution dictates the pace of Germany's game. His ability to get himself into dangerous positions near the box make him one of the most complete midfielders in world football. If there are no major upsets, and the favourites reach the last four, this will be where Germany bow out. Like many of my peers, I believe the squad is more balanced than in 2014. But the competitors have caught up. France, Brazil, Belgium, England: one of them will beat Germany. The Germany team has been flying high ever since the reboot of German football in the early 2000s. They have reached the last four at the 2006, 2010 and 2014 World Cups, and the 2008, 2012 and 2016 European Championships. Coming out of a difficult season for Bundesliga football, where Bayern again walked away with the title but were stopped in Europe once again, some players might be running low on confidence. On top of that, in recent tournaments defending champions Italy and Spain both failed to make it to the knockout stages. In spite of that, Low's XI will beat the curse of the titleholders and should reach a seventh consecutive semifinal. From there it's just a short walk to the final."
Mexico,"Mexico advanced to CONCACAF's Hexagonal round with 16 points, good enough for first place in their group. El Tri kicked off the final phase with a historic 2-1 win over the United States in Columbus, Ohio. Next came a scoreless draw in Panama, but Mexico won in its next three games. In its last five games in the round, Mexico secured two wins, two draws and a loss, and Juan Carlos Osorio's side wrapped up the qualifying phase in first place with 21 points. Mexico draws strength from its defense, displayed in all its glory during a Hexagonal round in which it allowed just seven goals. On offense, Hirving Lozano and Carlos Vela are having solid seasons with their respective clubs. Both could be key to El Tri's longstanding hopes of reaching the quarterfinal round. A major hole comes from Mexico's struggles to regain possession at midfield, which would help at both ends. El Tri also need a natural full-back who could pair with Miguel Layun. Several players have filled in, but few have thrived. Moreover, many fans believe Mexico's weakest link lies on its bench: Osorio has yet to establish a style of play, and his questionable rotations have been the target of much criticism. Hirving Lozano has emerged as Mexico's main figure for the World Cup. In just his first season in Europe, the young striker established himself as an important player for PSV. As a result, Mexico has pinned its hopes of reaching the quarterfinals on him. A good performance in Russia could prompt more elite European clubs to pay attention to “Chucky."" One must be a realist. I see a complicated group when it comes to the next round, truth be told. Thinking that Germany will win the group, Mexico will battle Sweden for second place. Perhaps people don't want to think beyond that because the next phase doesn't bode well for Mexico -- it's more likely that the Mexicans finish in second place, and that Brazil earns first in its group and would be the next opponent. The truth is a fifth game seems like a long shot. Mexico is in Group F with Germany, Sweden and South Korea, and will battle for the group's second berth because the defending champion Germans will almost assuredly earn the first-place slot. El Tri starts against Germany, and a good effort in that game could be key in the ensuing matchups and in their quest for the round of 16. If they pull through, Mexico could face Brazil and thus a tall order to reach the quarterfinals."
Sweden,"Drawn into a tough UEFA Group A with France, Netherlands and Bulgaria, Sweden weren't given a lot of respect by the onlookers following the international retirement of numerous veterans, including Zlatan Ibrahimovic. However, they surprised by finishing second ahead of Netherlands and then stunned the world by beating Italy in the playoffs by keeping a clean sheet over 180 minutes. That was a major triumph after failing to qualify for the previous two World Cup tournaments. It might sound a bit weird, but Sweden are much more competitive without Ibrahimovic. Granted, they are less glamorous and probably even less feared, but the dressing room is much more united these days. The team spirit is Sweden's biggest strength going into the tournament. Everyone feels part of the squad and everyone is capable of making significant contributions. With modest but ambitious coach Janne Andresson, who masterminded Norrkoping's amazing title triumph in 2015, on the touchline, they are also extremely well organised. Their motivation knows no bounds, the self-confidence is sky-high and they are very physically strong. In addition, key players Andreas Granqvist and Viktor Claesson ply their trade in Russia for Krasnodar. They will feel at home during the tournament. Unity is important, but Sweden definitely lack top quality and their squad is not deep enough to go far in the tournament. Apart from Emil Forsberg, no player can be considered a real star and some of the players have been in rough form lately. Victor Lindelof, the most promising centre-back, had a nightmare debut season at Manchester United. John Guidetti didn't find his feet at Alaves, Ola Toivonen is hardly playing for Toulouse, Marcus Berg chose to move to Al-Ain in Abu Dhabi and first-choice goalkeeper Robin Olsen suffered a very untimely injury. Emil Forsberg should be the leader and the major source of improvisation for Sweden. A bit shy and reserved, he offers a totally different impression as opposed to Ibrahimovic. The RB Leipzig playmaker provided 22 assists in the Bundesliga in 2015-16 and attracted attention of numerous top clubs. Blessed with vision and sublime technical skills, the midfielder, nicknamed ""Mini-Foppa,"" is a joy to watch when on song. He is a sound dead-ball specialist as well and has a keen eye for goal, scoring four times for Sweden in the qualifiers. The problem is that the current Bundesliga season has been much less successful for the schemer, who only had two goals and two assists for Leipzig. I am quite pessimistic about our chances, because our players are not getting regular playing time for their clubs. With Emil Forsberg losing his way at Leipzig, we could struggle to score goals, while problems in central midfield could see us getting overrun defensively. The situation is worse than ever ahead of a major tournament. We might be able to beat South Korea, but embarrassing heavy defeats against Germany and Mexico are not out of question. It will be difficult for us to qualify for the second round. With the most important players in the squad seemingly off form and Mexico always making it into the second round, it's only logical to predict that the Swedes would go out at the group stage. A lot will depend on the first game against South Korea, though, as a convincing win could turn things around."
South_Korea,"South Korea limped through the final round of Asian qualification and were helped over the line more by the failings of others than their own performances. Just four wins from 10 games, all of which came at home, equalled a far-from-convincing performance. It was so unimpressive that coach Uli Stielike was fired with two games remaining, and there was some criticism at home of players celebrating qualification when it finally came, saying that they had not done enough to deserve to do so. Despite their stumbles along the road to Russia, Korea have improved since under new coach Shin Tae-Yong. The Taeguk Warriors can attack at real speed, and just how fast they can be can be a shock: Colombia struggled to cope with the oncoming waves in a November friendly that marked the best performance in some time from the 2002 World Cup semifinalists. There is attacking talent, too. Son Heung-Min has starred for Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League and UEFA Champions League this season and is desperate to impress in the World Cup. The team also boasts classy midfielders in the shape of Ki Sung-Yeung, Lee Jae-Sung and Kwon Chang-Hoon. If these stars can click and get a little space to play, then Korea can really hurt teams. There is little doubt that defensively, the team has serious issues and has done for some time, almost since the days of Guus Hiddink and summer 2002. Fans have become accustomed to lapses of concentration at the back that suddenly result in a simple ball over the top sending the entire back line into panic. Add that to a tendency by the back four -- and it usually is a four, though a three is not impossible with a coach that likes to keep opponents guessing -- to commit individual mistakes, and there are problems. The goalkeepers can also be added to that. Kim Seung-Gyu is a fine No. 1 but is not world class and is guilty of making errors. Set pieces are a real problem, too, and Sweden, Mexico and Germany will be eager to attack. Son Heung-Min is the clear star of the team, and Korea's chances of progressing depend to a large extent on whether the 25-year-old can produce his best. So important has the forward become that Shin is ready to build the team around ""Sonaldo"" and has even discussed how best to use Son with Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino. The main question is whether it is best to play Son on the left side of attack, as a lone striker, with a second striker or with a genuine partner. The most promising experiment came at the end of 2017 in Korea's much-improved performances against Colombia and Serbia, when Son, and the whole attack, looked dangerous in a 4-4-2 formation.There are not so many high-quality players in this Korea team at the moment, which means that reaching the round of 16 will be very tough. Fans hope that Korea can at least give a positive showing in every match."
Belgium,"Belgium had a very easy campaign in UEFA's qualifying Group H, which seemed relatively straightforward in the first place with Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Estonia, Cyprus and Gibraltar. Apart from a rather unlucky home draw against the Greeks (they outshot them 17-2), the Red Devils didn't lose points and made sure of qualification long before the final fixture. They scored 43 goals in the process, Romelu Lukaku leading the way with 11 and Hazard adding six goals and five assists. To put it simply, there was no contest whatsoever. This is the golden generation of Belgian football and even the big stars of the 1980s, including Jan Ceulemans, agree that the current squad is the best ever. There is remarkable quality in every department, starting with Thibaut Courtois in goal. Jan Vertonghen, Toby Alderweireld and Vincent Kompany are all leading defenders plying their trade in England. Mousa Dembele and Radja Nainggolan are supreme in central midfield. Kevin De Bruyne is one the best playmakers in the world, the brightest star at all-conquering Manchester City. Hazard and Dries Mertens are outstanding wingers, with the latter starring as a centre-forward at Napoli in the last two seasons. Lukaku is one of the most powerful and prolific strikers in the Premier League. Martinez can pick a truly magnificent and experienced world-class lineup in every department, meaning they must be considered legitimate contenders to win the whole thing. The one hang-up is that the same players went to the 2014 World Cup and Euro 2016 and didn't deliver the expected results, mostly because they lacked a winning mentality and had tactical problems that resulted in poor balance between the stars. Martinez is a much more able tactician that his predecessor, Marc Wilmots, but some of the same problems remain. It is still unclear whether De Bruyne and Hazard can fulfil their potential together. The mistreatment of Nainggolan is stunning; preferring the likes of Axel Witsel and Marouane Fellaini in midfield is controversial to put it mildly. There is no decent natural left-back either, which is one of the reasons behind the switch to the 3-4-2-1 system. The general feeling is that this team still lacks the killer instinct and doesn't really believe in their ability to turn dreams into reality. Kevin De Bruyne has enjoyed the best season of his career at Manchester City, scoring eight goals, providing 15 assists and delivering countless other defense-splitting passes that led to goals and scoring opportunities but are not considered assists. Very few players in the world possess the Belgian's vision, and he is definitely one of the most pleasant players to watch. The 26-year-old flourished in a somewhat withdrawn role, and that idea was initially proposed by Martinez with the national team. Pep Guardiola used De Bruyne in that position and improved his game, and now he is ready to shine at the biggest stage, knowing that a brilliant World Cup would make him a legitimate contender for Ballon d'Or as well. The biggest question is whether is capable of becoming a true leader for Belgium. This really our best generation ever, especially as far as attacking potential is concerned. Martinez is an improvement on Wilmots on the bench, but the problem is that we will only be able to judge his abilities at the World Cup itself. There is significant criticism of his tactics within the squad, especially regarding the three-man defence. The gold medals tend to go to traditional forces at the World Cup, and Belgium are not one of them. Could they go all the way? I am a bit skeptical. Belgium should make it into the last 16 without problems, beating Panama and Tunisia. If they finish ahead of England and top Group G, Brazil could await them in the quarterfinals. If the finish second behind the Three Lions, they are likely to face Germany in the quarterfinals. That hurdle will be high and it is logical to predict that the Belgians would go out at that point, just like in 2014 and 2016. If they manage to overcome that hurdle, though, they could win the tournament."
Panama,"A complete lack of World Cup experience, which will be a significant disadvantage. Even with Panama's roster of seasoned players, competition at this highest of levels will take a toll. As if that weren't enough, Pamana's Group G features European powerhouses Belgium and England, while Tunisia also figure to be a difficult opponent. It won't be an easy debut for the Red Wave. Veteran keeper Jaime Penedo is the face of the team with 128 caps, the second-most ever for Panama. He plays for Dinamo Bucuresti, where he won a league cup with the Romanian first-division side in 2017. And he was the best goalkeeper in the 2005 and 2013 editions of the Gold Cup; in both instances, Panama finished as runner-up to the United States. My picks to advance to the knockout stage from Group G: Belgium and Panama. I don't want to appear smug when things go Panama's way in the World Cup. Panama's goal is to capitalize on the high of their first World Cup appearance. Any points earned in the group stage can be considered a plus, since it will be virtually impossible to advance against the likes of Belgium, England and Tunisia. In fact, anything but a last-place finish can be considered something to build on. Panama have an experienced manager in Hernan ""Bolillo"" Gomez, and that can help in putting forth a dignified effort."
Tunisia,"Tunisia were drawn into arguably the most favourable of the five African qualifying groups, with the Democratic Republic of Congo representing their sternest rivals. They took 10 points from their four matches against Libya and Guinea, memorably thumping the latter 4-1 in Conakry, but the group was ultimately settled during their double-header against the Leopards. Tunisia were outplayed for large spells in the first match in Rades, but snatched a 2-1 backs-against-the-walls triumph, and then hit the Congolese with two goals in two second-half minutes in Kinshasa to steal a 2-2 draw. The two matches were evidence of their resolve and ability to bounce back -- two qualities that should serve them well in Russia. Tunisia are ostensibly a team without stars, but they boast several excellent midfielders who should be well placed to hold their own against Belgium and England in their opening two fixtures. The trio of Ferjani Sassi, Mohamed Amine Ben Amor and Ghaylen Chaaleli offer balance, discipline and energy in the heart of the park, and will ensure that Tunisia remain competitive. They are a workmanlike bunch, but as they demonstrated in their recent qualifying victories, they will be disciplined and tenacious in protecting the backline. Wahbi Khazri and Naim Sliti offer a touch of class, a goal threat in the final third and decent set-piece delivery. Tunisia netted 11 goals in qualifying, but they were twice frustrated by a limited Libya side, only scoring once -- a Khazri penalty -- over 180 minutes. The loss of Youssef Msakni, the top scorer in the current set-up, is both a bitter personal blow for the player and denies Tunisia arguably their chief goal threat. The erratic forward netted a memorable hat trick in a scintillating evisceration of Guinea during the qualifiers, and it's hard to imagine Fakhreddine Ben Youssef or Taha Yassine Khenissi enjoying similar inspiration. Injury problems for Chaalali, Ben Amor and the influential Ali Maaloul are also concerns for Tunisia's coaching staff as the World Cup approaches. Wahbi Khazri may have flopped in England with Sunderland, but back on loan in France with Rennes, he has continued where he left off in Ligue 1. The talented playmaker has nine goals so far, demonstrating the kind of form that saw him linked to the Premier League originally, and relishes representing his country. He was shortlisted for this year's Marc-Vivien Foe Award and the threat he offers cutting in from the left, or from set pieces, will be a key weapon for Tunisia if they're to cause an upset in Russia. Fitness and form are serious problems. Beyond the absence of Youssef Msakni, which is denying the Tunisia team a key attacking asset, a major uncertainty weighs on other players, physically and psychologically, in an unenviable situation. Tunisia aren't a bad side, boasting a strong midfield and several exciting attacking talents. However, as soon as the draw was made, their chances of reaching the knockout rounds appeared slim. There aren't too many tougher opening fixtures for any side at the World Cup than England and Belgium, and Tunisia could already be out by the time they meet Panama in Saransk in their final fixture. The prognosis already looked bleak before a litany of injuries hit the squad and Msakni was ruled out, and it remains to be seen whether the likes of Maaloul, Chaalali, Rami Bedoui and Ben Amor could be replaced if they fail to make it back it time."
England,"England made light work of a favourable draw in the UEFA qualifying section, emerging unbeaten at the top of a Group F that included Slovakia, Scotland, Slovenia, Lithuania and Malta by a convincing eight-point margin. Scoring 18 goals and conceding three, the only points dropped by Southgate's men came in draws away from home against Slovakia and Scotland. Harry Kane netted five times to lead the team in front of goal, but the gulf in class between the group winners and the chasing pack was underlined by the fact that 11 other players also scored during the campaign. No longer weighed down by the need to configure their attack around a faded Wayne Rooney, England have all the tools to be one of the fastest and most athletic teams at the World Cup. This is a young, dynamic squad with searing pace on the flanks and plenty of lung power in midfield, even with the sad and untimely loss of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to injury. If they make it to the knockout stage and face teams who look to dominate possession, Raheem Sterling, Jamie Vardy and Marcus Rashford could be devastating in transition, while Danny Rose, Ryan Bertrand, Kyle Walker and Kieran Trippier can provide further thrust from defence. It's hard to single out one of many. England's modern history of tournament failure becomes a psychological millstone when pressure hits, while penalty shootouts against just about anyone remain a dreaded prospect. There are plenty of flaws in this squad, too. Few of the likely centre-back starters are playing regularly for their clubs at present, while none of England's central midfielders have the technical quality or tactical intelligence to control matches at the highest level. More ominous than anything else, though, is the sense that England still don't know what kind of team they want to be, and time is running out for Southgate to establish a coherent identity ahead of the World Cup. Harry Kane has a compelling claim to be considered the world's best striker and the deadliest finisher England have taken to a major tournament since Michael Owen in 2002. He is more than that, though: an all-round front-man with the intelligence to provide a reference point for an entire attack and make his teammates better. There are shades of both Alan Shearer and Teddy Sheringham in Kane's game and if he hits form, the Tottenham star can make England a threat to anyone. It would not be a surprise if Southgate names Kane his captain ahead of the tournament, although a repeat of Roy Hodgson's bizarre corner-taker experiment at Euro 2016 is best avoided. England will go as far as Kane's goals can take them, and so much will depend on what he has left in the tank after a long and arduous season. To win the World Cup is going to be a miracle, but we have got the players to do it. A lot of us play in probably the best league in the world. We've got the players to do it, but have we got the experience going further along in competitions? No, we haven't. Not in recent years. We need to be realistic. There are a lot of good teams out there and our record in tournaments has not been fantastic. We've had a lot of conversations inside the camp -- England haven't won a knockout game for God knows how many years, so for us to go there and win a knockout game, that would be a step in the right direction. Belgium are the strongest team on paper in Group G, but England should secure the runners-up slot with victories over Tunisia and Panama. That would set up a round-of-16 clash with the winner of Group H, most likely to be Colombia. Jose Pekerman's team are talented but beatable, and while any contest would be tight, Southgate can be optimistic of advancing as long as penalties are avoided. The benchmark of success should be reaching the quarterfinals, where familiar foes Germany will almost certainly be waiting to end their campaign."
Poland,"Poland easily finished top of the relatively comfortable UEFA Group E, winning eight out of 10 fixtures against Denmark, Montenegro, Romania, Armenia and Kazakhstan, even though their 4-0 defeat in Copenhagen was painful. They scored 28 goals, 16 of them coming from star striker Robert Lewandowski. The captain netted hat tricks in key home wins against Romania and Denmark, and their qualification was never really in doubt. Lewandowski finished as European qualifying's top scorer, and Bayern Munich's superstar would definitely be the main weapon in Russia. The Poles are much more than just one striker, though. Coach Adam Nawalka is a popular specialist who is building on a major success at Euro 2016, where Poles reached the quarterfinals and exited only on penalties. They have a solid backbone of experienced leaders, including centre-back Kamil Glik, defender Lukasz Piszczek and midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak, who are ably complemented by rising young stars like Piotr Zielinski and Karol Linetty. It is a very promising blend that could possibly develop into worthy successors to the majestic Poland teams of the 1970s and '80s that were considered some of the best in the world. Some of the key players didn't have a good club season, which is especially true of Krychowiak who wasn't even a certain starter at West Brom. Arkadiusz Milik barely featured at Napoli after yet another significant injury setback, Kuba Blaszczykowski was injured for most of the season at Wolfsburg, Kamil Grosicki went astray at Hull City, while Wojciech Szczesny spent the season as a bench-warmer behind Gianluigi Buffon at Juventus. Even Lewandowski came under pressure at Bayern Munich for failing to prove his worth in the Champions League. Nawalka needs all of his stars in top form in a difficult group, and Poland might be in trouble if many of them underperform. Finding the right balance in midfield between Krychowiak and Zielinski is another major issue. Robert Lewandowski probably could be considered the greatest-ever Polish footballer already, but he needs a major achievement with the national team to cement his place in history. He is Poland's most prolific player of all time, overtaking Wlodzimierz Lubanski with 52 goals in 93 matches. His form for Bayern was magnificent, with 39 goals in all competitions, but his leadership qualities will come under the spotlight in Russia. Lewandowski had a relatively quiet tournament at Euro 2016, scoring just once, and must be much more efficient at the World Cup if Poland are to go far and become the dark horses. The hope is to reach the quarterfinals, like at Euro 2016, and that target was set by the coach at the start of the qualification campaign. The current generation has what it takes to get there, with some of the players seeing the World Cup as the peak of their international careers. They would also love to prove that they are not a one-man team. The first game against Senegal is the most important. If we win, things will get real. If we lose, everything will be complicated. Group G is very even, and any team can finish top or bottom. Fans are optimistic because we are going to Russia focused and result-oriented. If everything clicks, Poland can be a dark horse and go very far, because they have the right ingredients and a good balance. On the other hand, their rivals in Group H -- especially Senegal and Colombia -- are extremely dangerous, and the adventure could easily end after just three fixtures. It really could go either way. If one absolutely must to make a prediction, though, let us settle for a place in the quarterfinals."
Senegal,"Senegal qualified unbeaten from CAF's Group D after taking 14 points from their six matches, winning four and scoring 10 goals. Their campaign wasn't completely plain sailing, however, and they were made to wait for qualification after letting a 2-1 lead away at Burkina Faso slip in the 88th minute. They were helped by Cape Verde's slow start and the Stallions' inconsistency, and wrapped up qualification with victory over South Africa in Polokwane. Cisse has options across the park, with a wealth of talented forward options, a clutch of rugged and powerful midfielders and the kind of central defensive options that mean the squad can absorb the likely absence of Kara Mbodji because of injury. The key area of strength, however, is in midfield, where Idrissa Gueye performs a key duty, snuffing out opposition attacks and protecting his defence. He has not enjoyed his best campaign at Everton this term, but his defensive numbers have rivalled those of N'Golo Kante in recent seasons, and he's the centrepiece of a strong unit that should contain the likes of Kouyate, Alfred N'Diaye and Cheikh N’Doye. Despite succeeding in ending Senegal's wait for a return to the World Cup, doubts persist about Cisse's aptitude as a coach, particularly when it comes to tactical decisions. Even with the significant attacking options at his disposal, he has yet to truly meld Senegal into a fearsome offensive team, and Cisse has yet to get the best out of his team as an attacking force. Keita Balde, M'Baye Niang and Ismaila Sarr are potentially magnificent supporting actors for Sadio Mane, but they've rarely shown anything close to their best for the national side. Sadio Mane may not have received the same acclaim as he did during his first season at Liverpool, when he was named his team's Player of the Year despite a stop-start campaign, but he remains one of the Premier League's outstanding talents. To date, he has weighed in with 17 contributions in the top flight -- 10 goals and seven assists -- while he has also played a key role in firing Liverpool into another Champions League final. Only the imperious Mohamed Salah has been more influential in Liverpool's campaign -- Mane has eight goals in nine outings -- but could the forward step out of his rival's shadow in Russia? Senegal have a chance at the 2018 World Cup because they have a competitive team that can challenge their three opponents -- Colombia, Poland and Japan. The players and the whole nation are confident, and everybody here believes that the Lions will follow the same path as they did in 2002 -- their first World Cup [when Senegal reached the quarterfinals]. ... There's a funny stat for Senegal at the World Cup. Anytime we've played in one -- including beach soccer, U-20s or mini football -- we've always reached the second round or the quarterfinal lesson [at least]. Senegal have the raw material and the talent to emulate the class of 2002 and reach the quarterfinals. However, it remains to be seen whether Cisse is the man to pull the various elements of this team together to forge a side that can get the best out of its key assets. The evidence of the recent international break suggests that the coach, a veteran of the 2002 squad, is no closer to stumbling upon the truly effective formula that would see them past Colombia, Poland and Japan. However, Senegal have already stunned the watching world once on the grandest stage of all, and if this collective can click, they're capable of doing so once again."
Colombia,"Colombia's qualifying campaign wasn't long-suffering but it wasn't a walk in the park either. They lost points against the stronger teams, but they always capitalized on the weaker ones. They lost both of their games against Argentina and couldn't manage any wins against Brazil, Uruguay or Chile. Their best moments were a clear win over then unbeaten Ecuador and a tie in Lima on the final matchday against Peru, which earned them automatic qualification. It's clear that Colombia has the players to compete against the very best. They have players used to playing in the top European leagues at every position, led by James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao. The Bayern Munich No.10 finished top scorer at the 2014 World Cup and arrives in Russia in top shape; he's already one of the tournament's favorites to score the most goals. Falcao also has high personal expectations for this tournament after missing the last World Cup through injury. Colombia's 2014 World Cup squad adds two new center-backs who will mark an era: Davinson Sanchez and Yerry Mina. They make up a solid backline with Santiago Arias and Frank Fabra while other quality players like Juan Cuadrado and Luis Muriel boost the team. Even though the Colombia national team has participated in the bigger international tournaments over the past few cycles, they have come up short against the best teams in the top competitions. They need to believe they have the individual and collective assets required to defeat anyone. Another issue that's come up after Brazil 2014 is the lack of strength in the midfield. They are too often overplayed in that area, which negates their quality at both ends. Jose Pekerman should go for a dynamic and creative midfield in order to boost his forwards. James Rodriguez was already Colombia's best player before the 2014 World Cup but nobody expected he would become one of the best in the world. At 22, he ended up being the tournament's top scorer and the leader of the best team Colombia has ever deployed at a World Cup. He added personality and attitude to lead his team in each and every game he played. Nowadays, as a more mature player with experience at two of the top clubs in Europe and coming off a good season at Bayern Munich, Colombian fans will be expecting a lot of him. Because of the level of play shown by their footballers in Europe, Colombia should have as an objective to play five games in Russia 2018 just as they did in Brazil 2014. James Rodriguez, Radamel Falcao, Juan Guillermo Cuadrado and Davinson Sánchez are at their best and allow all Colombians to dream of another historical performance. It's difficult to predict the fortune of a team in a competition such as a World Cup, since there are factors at stake that surpass football itself. However, one can try to outline a possible path and determine which result would be considered a success. If they aim to match their performance in Brazil, they will have to defeat England or Belgium in the round of 16, either of which would be a spectacular challenge for a group of players eager to show their worth. To reach the quarterfinals would be a resounding success while the least expected accomplishment for an acceptable performance would be a victory in the Round of 16."
Japan,"Despite a turbulent campaign, Japan won their group in Asian qualifying to secure their place at the finals, finishing ahead of Saudi Arabia by a solitary point to advance to a sixth consecutive World Cup. A 2-0 win over Australia in their penultimate game saw them book their place and secure first position in the group, claiming one of two automatic berths at the finals as a result. An experienced group of players at their core, several of whom will be appearing at their third World Cup, means Japan will go into the finals in Russia knowing what lies ahead when they take on Poland, Senegal and Colombia. Eiji Kawashima, Keisuke Honda, Yuto Nagatomo, Shinji Okazaki and captain Makoto Hasebe all played in 2010 and 2014 and it will be up to them to give the team the much-needed lift behind the scenes after a difficult lead-in to the finals. Japan's comfort in possession remains a positive. After a disjointed qualifying campaign and a difficult set of friendlies in the buildup to the finals, the sacking of Vahid Halilhodzic has caused significant turbulence within a squad that has been left with just two months to repair the damage under new coach Akira Nishino. The former Gamba Osaka boss, who won the Asian Champions League title in 2008, has never coached at a World Cup, although he led Japan at the Olympic Games in 1996, where they pulled off a surprise win over Brazil. Keisuke Honda remains the biggest star in Japanese football, even though his influence on the pitch has been on the wane in recent times as a lack of playing time in a top level league has blunted his edge. In a team arguably lacking the personality and quality of previous editions, the bleached-blond attacker will generate the headlines at home while his influence in the dressing room, especially among the younger players, remains important. It is likely new coach Nishino will lean on Honda to lift the spirits in the buildup to the finals, and the 31-year-old has managed to reclaim some form after joining Pachuca in Mexico after a disappointing three-and-a-half season spell with AC Milan. I don't think Japan will make a major impact at the World Cup because of the situation in the team. Changing the coach two months before the tournament was not the right thing to do and almost nobody understands the reasons. Sure, the recent results and performances were not good and Halilhodzic's manner was not suitable for Japan but can a new manager instill better tactics in less than two months? Maybe the shock of what has happened can turn things into something of a positive, but I don't think it will be enough to beat strong teams like Poland, Senegal and Colombia. Japan have twice reached the knockout phase of the World Cup, in 2002 and 2010, so anything less than a run to the round of 16 will be seen as unacceptable even under the circumstances the Japan Football Association created by firing Halilhodzic. But Japan have been in a steady decline for much of the past decade, with some attractive football failing to mask the shortcomings of the Samurai Blue. Nishino was appointed in mid-April and will have less than a handful of matches to put over his message to a squad that is low on morale and also lacking the quality of previous incarnations. It's hard to see anything other than a first round exit for Japan -- should they go into the final round of group games with a chance of advancing, that could be deemed to be something of a success."
United_States,"Josh Sargent scored on his debut as a youthful United States side beat Bolivia 3-0 in an international friendly in Chester, Pennsylvania on Monday. Sargent became the fourth-youngest American to score, making an audacious interception of a goalkeeper's pass over his head to put the ball into the net in his international debut at just 18 years, 102 days. Tim Weah, two days younger than Sargent, got his first goal seven minutes later. ""It's great feeling both of us getting to do this together,"" Sargent said. Walker Zimmerman, a relative veteran at 25 but making just his third international appearance, put the Americans ahead in the 37th minute with his first international goal -- a header from Joe Corona's corner kick. Sargent doubled the lead in the 52nd. ""We've come such a long way,"" said Weah, a son of former FIFA Player of the Year and current Liberia President George Weah. ""We just want to impress our fans. We just want to play with our hearts.” Christian Pulisic struggled to make sharp touches in his first national team match since the loss at Trinidad and Tobago last October that ended the U.S. streak of seven consecutive World Cup appearances. Interim U.S. coach Dave Sarachan gave six players their debuts, raising the total to 15 in four matches since he took over after the loss in Trinidad. Defenders Erik Palmer-Brown and Antonee Robinson and goalkeeper Alex Bono joined Sargent as debutants in the starting lineup, and defender Matt Olosunde and midfielder Keaton Parks entered in the second half. The U.S. starting lineup averaged 22 years, 160 days, and 6.7 international appearances. Fans always have sky-high hopes prospects will become stars, and Sargent and Weah raised the anticipation even higher. ""They're reading a lot about themselves and so on,"" Sarachan said. ""They're still steps. If you want to get to A, you still start at D and then to C, then to B. We're very quick to jump them up into the A category. I think that's a process that we have to manage, with expectations, with a lot of noise on the outside.” Only three Americans have scored at a younger age than Weah and Sargent: Pulisic (17 years, 253 days), Juan Agudelo at South Africa in 2010 (17-359) and Jozy Altidore against Mexico in 2008 (18-96). Agudelo is the only younger player to score in his debut. Weah has played just three first-team matches for Paris Saint-Germain, one of his father's former clubs, entering twice as a second-half sub in March and getting his first start on the final day of the season this month. Sargent hasn't played any. Sargent scored four goals at last year's Under-20 World Cup and three at the Under-17 World Cup, where Weah was a teammate. He signed a pro contract with Werder Bremen on his 18th birthday, Feb. 20. That was after the international transfer window closed, making him ineligible until next season. ""I was very nervous to be honest coming out,"" Sargent said. ""It was my first professional game ever.” He made up for lack of experience with daring. Goalkeeper Carlos Lampe rolled the ball to Luis Haquin on the right flank, and the defender returned it. Lampe lofted the ball back toward Haquin. Sargent turned toward the touchline to follow the flight of the ball, stuck out his right leg near the edge of the penalty area to redirect it back toward the center of the field, and then ran onto the ball for an 11-yard right-footed shot that deflected in off the keeper's leg. I saw him start to chip the ball over, so I started backing up a little bit, and had a good touch to turn it around and good shot,"" Sargent said. Weah scored after Antonee Robinson beat a defender down the left flank and made a one-hop cross into the penalty area. Weah made a perfect cut and volleyed the ball with his right foot. ""Once I saw the service come in, I was like, I got to get there. I got to get this. This is my opportunity to get the goal,"" Weah said exuberantly. He had felt pain in his right knee after a challenge about 15 minutes in and signaled he needed to come off. ""He was all over the shop,"" Sarachan said. ""He looked like a kid that has never played at a higher level, to a guy that was looking to come out a game where he wasn't sure if he was even hurt to flying and beating guys. And so he was the prototypical young, nervous guy."""
